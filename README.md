🧠 Mental Health Diagnosis System

A machine learning-based project designed to assist in the early detection of potential mental health conditions through data-driven insights. This system analyzes user-provided data and predicts the likelihood of certain mental health disorders, aiming to spread awareness and encourage timely professional consultation.

📌 Features

✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Cleans, encodes, and prepares mental health survey data.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifies patterns, correlations, and insights in mental health trends.

✅ Machine Learning Models – Implements classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.).

✅ Performance Evaluation – Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

✅ Visualization Dashboard – Provides charts and graphs for better interpretability.

✅ User-Friendly Interface – Simple input system for prediction and result interpretation.

🏗️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-diagnosis.git
cd mental-health-diagnosis

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Application

If using Streamlit:

streamlit run app.py


If using Flask:

python app.py

📊 Dataset

The system is trained on a mental health survey dataset containing attributes such as:

Age, Gender, Employment, Work Interference

Family history of mental illness

Treatment history

Social support and accessibility to mental health resources

(Note: Dataset used is anonymized and publicly available for research purposes.)

📈 Model Workflow

Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (correlation heatmaps, feature importance)

Model Training (multiple algorithms tested for performance)

Evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)

Deployment (interactive web interface)

📌 Future Enhancements

🏥 Integration with real-time chatbots for mental health assistance

🌐 Multi-language support

📱 Mobile app integration

🔒 Stronger privacy & security measures
